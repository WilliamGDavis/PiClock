# PiClock (C# UWP)
PiClock is an application designed for the Raspberry Pi and a 7" Touchscreen, using Windows IOT Core.  It is a C# UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app and hooks into (for now) a PHP-based RPC server.

The purpose of PiClock is to allow employees to punch into a timeclock, and keep track of the time spent on jobs. A requirement set in place by the client is the use of a simple PIN system, with no other user authentication.  

PiClock is a 3-part application, comprising of the timeclocks, the admin interface, and the RPC webservice.  

The design intent of the timeclock portion of PiClock is to allow the employees fast access to punching in, quick and easy job tracking, and the ability to see the current progress of their punches throughout the week.


Still a WIP, but progressing nicely.
